@(games: Seq[Game], form: Form[Game])(implicit messages: Messages)

@* the template file is like a function and therefore it can have expected arguments *@
@* in this case it is expecting a collection of CD's for us to display  *@
@* it also expects a form of type CD *@
@* then we have the implicit messages in the second set of arguments *@
@* the implicit messages is required for the form helper to build up the form *@
@* due to the plays ability of supporting internationalisation *@

@main("Games") {

  @* Some HTML code to list out the CD's that we passed in a table with two columns *@
  <h1>Games</h1>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Price</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    @for(game <- games) {
      <tr><td>@game.name</td><td>@game.price</td></tr>
    }
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <hr/>

  @* helper.form basically replaces the need for you to define the form in HTML *@
  @* we start by using the helper.form and inside the parentheses we define where this form *@
  @* will be posted to *@
  @* after that we define the input text fields to which we pass the form which was passed by the  *@
  @* controller method and define that this inputText field is the name field which we need for our CD case class *@
  @* additionally we are able to pass other fields for when the text field is created so that the HTML for it  *@
  @* would have a specific id and a class set *@
  @* if you don't want to define the additional fields then you can just pass the form and to which case class  *@
  @* field this maps to *@
  @* lastly we have a button to actually submit this form *@
  @helper.form(routes.Application.createGame()) {
    @* an example of how we can pass additional arguments for the helper *@
    @* in this CD example having '_showConstraints -> false will hide the requirement Required *@
    @helper.inputText(form("name"), '_label -> "Name", '_showConstraints -> false)
    @helper.inputText(form("price"), '_label -> "Price" , '_showConstraints -> false)
    <button type="submit">Create Game</button>
  }

  @* This helper will generate the HTML for this form and it will look like this *@
  @* <form action="/cds" method="POST">
  <dl class=" " id="name_field">
  <dt><label for="name">Name</label></dt>
  <dd>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="">
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <dl class=" " id="price_field">
  <dt><label for="price">Price</label></dt>
  <dd>
  <input type="text" id="price" name="price" value="">
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <button type="submit">Create CD</button>
  </form> *@
